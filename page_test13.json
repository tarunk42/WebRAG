I just got them today so the real test will be at work tomorrow but just trying them out for less than a few minutes I found them to be great. My kids were even fighting over them to be their school set. \ud83e\udd23 thank God they are Bluetooth because my only answer I could think of were they didn't have a cord for their laptops. \ud83d\ude05 overall though they seem a little small on my head but I think that's in part due to have a blue parrot trucker set previously and it's bulky. Ear insides show l and r for right and left which is awesome. It is type c charging and covered while on your head from how the ear pieces twist which is great. When I put them on I thought it was pretty loud but not loud enough for the factory so I made sure the volume was all the way up and it wasn't. It was only 1/2 way which is great because at full volume I couldn't hear my kids fighting so I'm sure it will be loud enough in the factory. Can't say much about battery life just yet as I only tested them out but I can update after work a few days. The buttons are in a nice spot too so I don't turn it off/up/down while adjusting it on my head like my current set. Overall probably the best 50 bucks I spent in a long time. I don't treat myself much or really at all due to being a single mom of 4, the kids and the bills get everything I have 247 but I wanted to make work just a tad bit more pleasurable and these will do it. They don't seem flimsy either which is a plus. Hopefully I still love them in a few months since my blue parrot has lasted 2 years before the mic breaking. These I can answer calls on while working. Pretty excited for work now. \ud83e\udd23\nRead more\n\n\n39 people found this helpful\nHelpful\nReport\nAshley Rankin\nWorks as intended.\nReviewed in the United States on October 5, 2024\nColor: PurpleVerified Purchase\nThe sound is great and I appreciate that I can adjust my sound preferences in the app. It comes in a very stylish purple color and looks well made.

Supported by the JBL headphones app so has some features like an equalizer, music/video modes and other options. Buetooth connection was instant, no issues at all. Most importantly, the color is a very nice shade of wisteria.\n\nAnd the packaging had no plastic, that's neat.\n2 people found this helpful\nHelpful\nReport\nChloe Sage\nBeautiful lavender color\nReviewed in the United States on June 6, 2024\nColor: PurpleVerified Purchase\nI was wanting these headphones bc I saw them at target a few days ago. They are about the same price as Target. My AirPod Pros don\u2019t work anymore they just die. I only had them since 2021 and couldn\u2019t use them cuz my ears have been sensitive to loud sound since 2021. Plus these don\u2019t fall off like my AirPods do if I move around or out my head down. So I wanted to find a good pair of headphones over ear. These are nice that you can customize the sound with the JBL App. It was a bit confusing at first but then I figured out how to connect them to my phone through Bluetooth no problem. I like that I can switch to vocal sound and video sound when watching movies or shows or listening to music on my phone. I love the lavender color it\u2019s my favorite color. BUT the ear cuffs are so tiny. I have tiny ears but even these are too small for me. It\u2019s a bit difficult to adjust them too for the head. I haven\u2019t figured it out yet to adjust to my size yet. Oh and the headphones bend to close to put away without taking up too much space. They are soft in the ear cuffs. But too small even for me with tiny ears. Makes me sad. I might return these and invest in a pricier pair of JBL over-ear headphones if these don\u2019t work for me. I\u2019ll give it a go and if they still bother me with the tiny ear cuffs then I\u2019ll return them. Oh and I also purchased a case that matches the color of these super cute. Oh also another thing when I set them to studio my ears weren\u2019t hurting cuz I mentioned in my review here that I have sensitive ears since 2021. So having a headphones to not hurt my ears is also important to me. Cuz my AirPods would hurt my ears. So this is my review hope it helps someone decide to get these or not.\nRead more\n\n\n45 people found this helpful\nHelpful\nReport\nSee more reviews\nTop reviews from other countries\nTranslate all reviews to English\nAlejandra\nExcelentes\nReviewed in Mexico on November 14, 2024\nColor: WhiteVerified Purchase\nCalidad precio excelente, los aud\u00edfonos m\u00e1s geniales\nReport\nTranslate review to English\nMelanie\nGreat head set\nReviewed in Canada on November 8, 2024\nColor: PurpleVerified Purchase\nIf you have a small head and little ears these fit perfectly. The sound is awesome and there is an app to control the sound. Super light weight and pretty good with canceling out sound but not fully noise canceling. It was super easy to connect to blue tooth and you can pair them to two different devices. The back of the head phone has a pad so it won't rub on your neck . The only thing that I don't care for is that they kind of hurt my ears after wearing them for a long period of time good for short use though. If you have a bigger head I wouldn't suggest them but good for a Yong adult /adult with a smaller head .\nOver all super happy with these as I don't feel like they take over my head as I have a small head for an adult .\nReport\nLuis\nBuen producto\nReviewed in Mexico on November 5, 2024\nColor: BlackVerified Purchase\nTienen una buena relaci\u00f3n calidad-precio, la app con la que se vinculan es muy \u00fatil, la calidad de los materiales parece bastante duradera, buena calidad de audio y excelente rendimiento de bater\u00eda, sin duda volver\u00eda a comprarlos.\nReport\nTranslate review to English\nIZCOATL CURIEL\nPr\u00e1cticos y de gran calidad!\nReviewed in Mexico on November 1, 2024\nColor: PurpleVerified Purchase\nLos he comprado tres veces (unos para m\u00ed y dos que he regalado), no tengo un o\u00eddo entrenado o profesional, pero me encanta la m\u00fasica y desde mi punto de vista suenan excelente, la bater\u00eda dura milenios, son ligeros lo que los hace c\u00f3modos de usar y se pliegan para transportarlos f\u00e1cilmente; como un plus, tienen una app en la que puedes elegir diferentes tipos de ecualizaci\u00f3n.\n\nEl color es precioso y combinan con mi vaso :).\n\n\n\n\nReport\nTranslate review to English\nRa\u00f9l\nExcelentes muy c\u00f3modos\nReviewed in Mexico on October 3, 2024\nColor: BlueVerified Purchase\nMe gust\u00f3 mucho el color, se ajustan bien y la cancelaci\u00f3n de ruido bastante aceptable.

I just got them today so the real test will be at work tomorrow but just trying them out for less than a few minutes I found them to be great. My kids were even fighting over them to be their school set. \ud83e\udd23 thank God they are Bluetooth because my only answer I could think of were they didn't have a cord for their laptops. \ud83d\ude05 overall though they seem a little small on my head but I think that's in part due to have a blue parrot trucker set previously and it's bulky. Ear insides show l and r for right and left which is awesome. It is type c charging and covered while on your head from how the ear pieces twist which is great. When I put them on I thought it was pretty loud but not loud enough for the factory so I made sure the volume was all the way up and it wasn't. It was only 1/2 way which is great because at full volume I couldn't hear my kids fighting so I'm sure it will be loud enough in the factory. Can't say much about battery life just yet as I only tested them out but I can update after work a few days. The buttons are in a nice spot too so I don't turn it off/up/down while adjusting it on my head like my current set. Overall probably the best 50 bucks I spent in a long time. I don't treat myself much or really at all due to being a single mom of 4, the kids and the bills get everything I have 247 but I wanted to make work just a tad bit more pleasurable and these will do it. They don't seem flimsy either which is a plus. Hopefully I still love them in a few months since my blue parrot has lasted 2 years before the mic breaking. These I can answer calls on while working.

The app lets you control bass, treble, etc. the sound quality is so good. My AirPods hurt my ears and don\u2019t last very long so I decided to find a cheaper alternative and this is definitely a product that is cheap and great quality. Had to come back to give a 5 \u2b50\ufe0f.\n11 people found this helpful\nHelpful\nReport\nSeraphiel\nGreat on ear headphones with a phenomenal battery life.\nReviewed in the United States on November 20, 2024\nColor: PurpleVerified Purchase\nGreat on ear headphones with a phenomenal battery life, came out of the box with 80% charged. Supported by the JBL headphones app so has some features like an equalizer, music/video modes and other options. Buetooth connection was instant, no issues at all. Most importantly, the color is a very nice shade of wisteria.\n\nAnd the packaging had no plastic, that's neat.\n2 people found this helpful\nHelpful\nReport\nChloe Sage\nBeautiful lavender color\nReviewed in the United States on June 6, 2024\nColor: PurpleVerified Purchase\nI was wanting these headphones bc I saw them at target a few days ago. They are about the same price as Target. My AirPod Pros don\u2019t work anymore they just die. I only had them since 2021 and couldn\u2019t use them cuz my ears have been sensitive to loud sound since 2021. Plus these don\u2019t fall off like my AirPods do if I move around or out my head down. So I wanted to find a good pair of headphones over ear. These are nice that you can customize the sound with the JBL App. It was a bit confusing at first but then I figured out how to connect them to my phone through Bluetooth no problem. I like that I can switch to vocal sound and video sound when watching movies or shows or listening to music on my phone. I love the lavender color it\u2019s my favorite color. BUT the ear cuffs are so tiny. I have tiny ears but even these are too small for me. It\u2019s a bit difficult to adjust them too for the head. I haven\u2019t figured it out yet to adjust to my size yet. Oh and the headphones bend to close to put away without taking up too much space. They are soft in the ear cuffs. But too small even for me with tiny ears. Makes me sad. I might return these and invest in a pricier pair of JBL over-ear headphones if these don\u2019t work for me. I\u2019ll give it a go and if they still bother me with the tiny ear cuffs then I\u2019ll return them. Oh and I also purchased a case that matches the color of these super cute. Oh also another thing when I set them to studio my ears weren\u2019t hurting cuz I mentioned in my review here that I have sensitive ears since 2021. So having a headphones to not hurt my ears is also important to me. Cuz my AirPods would hurt my ears. So this is my review hope it helps someone decide to get these or not.\nRead more\n\n\n45 people found this helpful\nHelpful\nReport\nSee more reviews\nTop reviews from other countries\nTranslate all reviews to English\nAlejandra\nExcelentes\nReviewed in Mexico on November 14, 2024\nColor: WhiteVerified Purchase\nCalidad precio excelente, los aud\u00edfonos m\u00e1s geniales\nReport\nTranslate review to English\nMelanie\nGreat head set\nReviewed in Canada on November 8, 2024\nColor: PurpleVerified Purchase\nIf you have a small head and little ears these fit perfectly. The sound is awesome and there is an app to control the sound. Super light weight and pretty good with canceling out sound but not fully noise canceling. It was super easy to connect to blue tooth and you can pair them to two different devices. The back of the head phone has a pad so it won't rub on your neck . The only thing that I don't care for is that they kind of hurt my ears after wearing them for a long period of time good for short use though. If you have a bigger head I wouldn't suggest them but good for a Yong adult /adult with a smaller head .\nOver all super happy with these as I don't feel like they take over my head as I have a small head for an adult .\nReport\nLuis\nBuen producto\nReviewed in Mexico on November 5, 2024\nColor: BlackVerified Purchase\nTienen una buena relaci\u00f3n calidad-precio, la app con la que se vinculan es muy \u00fatil, la calidad de los materiales parece bastante duradera, buena calidad de audio y excelente rendimiento de bater\u00eda, sin duda volver\u00eda a comprarlos.\nReport\nTranslate review to English\nIZCOATL CURIEL\nPr\u00e1cticos y de gran calidad!\nReviewed in Mexico on November 1, 2024\nColor: PurpleVerified Purchase\nLos he comprado tres veces (unos para m\u00ed y dos que he regalado), no tengo un o\u00eddo entrenado o profesional, pero me encanta la m\u00fasica y desde mi punto de vista suenan excelente, la bater\u00eda dura milenios, son ligeros lo que los hace c\u00f3modos de usar y se pliegan para transportarlos f\u00e1cilmente; como un plus, tienen una app en la que puedes elegir diferentes tipos de ecualizaci\u00f3n.\n\nEl color es precioso y combinan con mi vaso :).\n\n\n\n\nReport\nTranslate review to English\nRa\u00f9l\nExcelentes muy c\u00f3modos\nReviewed in Mexico on October 3, 2024\nColor: BlueVerified Purchase\nMe gust\u00f3 mucho el color, se ajustan bien y la cancelaci\u00f3n de ruido bastante aceptable.
