      "The sky appears blue because of a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering, named after the British physicist Lord Rayleigh. He discovered that when sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere, it encounters tiny molecules of gases such as nitrogen (N2) and oxygen (O2). These molecules scatter the light in all directions, but they scatter shorter (blue) wavelengths more than longer (red) wavelengths.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's a simplified explanation:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Sunlight enters the atmosphere**: The sun emits white light, which is made up of all the colors of the visible spectrum.\n",
      "2. **Light interacts with atmospheric molecules**: When sunlight hits the tiny molecules in the air, it scatters in all directions.\n",
      "3. **Molecules scatter shorter wavelengths more**: The smaller molecules (like nitrogen and oxygen) are more effective at scattering the shorter wavelengths of light, such as blue and violet.\n",
      "4. **Blue light is scattered in all directions**: As a result, the blue light is dispersed throughout the atmosphere, reaching our eyes from all parts of the sky.\n",
      "5. **Our eyes perceive the blue color**: When we look up at the sky, we see the scattered blue light, which gives the sky its characteristic blue color.\n",
      "\n",
      "The reason the sky isn't always blue is that other factors can affect the amount of sunlight that reaches our eyes:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Atmospheric conditions**: Dust, pollution, and water vapor in the air can scatter light in different ways, changing the apparent color of the sky.\n",
      "* **Time of day**: During sunrise and sunset, the sun's rays have to travel through more of the atmosphere, which scatters the shorter wavelengths even more, making the sky appear red or orange.\n",
      "* **Clouds and weather**: Clouds can block or scatter sunlight, altering the apparent color of the sky.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, in summary, the sky appears blue because of the scattering of sunlight by tiny molecules in the Earth's atmosphere, with a preference for shorter (blue) wavelengths.\n",
