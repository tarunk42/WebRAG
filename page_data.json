It's perfect for a variety of tasks, from assembling furniture to tackling small DIY projects around the house. The battery lasts well, and it's so easy to use.\n\nThe screwdriver is surprisingly powerful for its size, and it handles most screws with ease.\n\nThe only downside I've found is that it can struggle a bit with undoing really tight screws. You might need to give it a little extra muscle to get them out.\nOverall, I'm very happy with this screwdriver. It's designed well, lightweight, convenient, and does a great job.\nHelpful\nReport\nCharlotte M.\nNot bad for the money\nReviewed in the United Kingdom on 13 August 2024\nColour Name: BlackVerified Purchase\nNot a professional tool but perfectly adequate for home/DIY use. Feels a bit flimsy but has reasonable torque.\nHelpful\nReport\nEmily Ward\nRechargeable drill.\nReviewed in the United Kingdom on 3 October 2024\nVerified Purchase\nLove this, it's helped me with DIY around the house. Loads of extra bits. For the price it was an excellent buy. Bargin\nHelpful\nReport\nGlamorepuss\nFantastic Tool for DIY Enthusiasts\nReviewed in the United Kingdom on 25 April 2024\nVerified Purchase\nI recently purchased the Pink Cordless Screwdriver with 40 Extra Pieces, and I must say, I absolutely love it! As someone who enjoys tackling DIY projects around the house, this tool has quickly become an essential part of my toolkit.\n\nFirst off, the color is just adorable \u2013 the vibrant pink adds a fun touch to my collection of tools. But beyond aesthetics, this screwdriver is incredibly functional. The cordless design makes it convenient to use anywhere without being attached to a plug, and the ergonomic adjustable handle provides a comfortable grip for extended use.\n\nThe 40 extra pieces and the handy little box to keep everything in is a fantastic bonus. With a variety of bits and attachments included, I have everything I need to tackle a wide range of tasks, from assembling furniture to hanging shelves.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised by the power and efficiency of this screwdriver. It effortlessly drives screws into various materials without stripping or slipping, saving me time and frustration.\n\nOverall, I can't recommend this Pink Cordless Screwdriver enough. It's stylish, reliable, and versatile \u2013 perfect for DIY enthusiasts of all skill levels. Whether you're a seasoned handyperson or a beginner looking to tackle your first project, this tool is a must-have addition to your toolbox.\nRead more\n4 people found this helpful\nHelpful\nReport\nYouYu\nIts a toy not tool\nReviewed in the United Kingdom on 27 August 2024\nVerified Purchase\nI was really disappointed with this cordless screwdriver. First, while it claims to be 47-in-1, the actual quality of the attachments is terrible. The bits wear out quickly and become loose after only a few uses. Secondly, the 3 N.m torque is far too weak. It struggles with anything more than light screws and is basically useless for tougher jobs.\n\nThe battery life is another major issue. It barely lasts an hour, and recharging takes forever, making it very inconvenient to use. The LED light is also not bright enough, offering little help when working in dimly lit areas. While the pink design may look cute, it feels like they focused more on the appearance than functionality.\n\nOverall, this screwdriver fails to perform even basic household tasks, and I wouldn\u2019t recommend it to anyone.\n2 people found this helpful\nHelpful\nReport\nCd\nCompact\nReviewed in the United Kingdom on 25 September 2024\nColour Name: OrangeVerified Purchase\nThis is a great little drill/screwdriver, perfect for me with Multiple Sclerosis as I don't have strength to undo or tighten screws with a manual screwdriver. Great for little jobs around the house. Easy to use, does the job perfectly and comes in a compact case with everything required inside. Arrived promptly.\nHelpful\nReport\nAmazon Customer\nSaves the effort.\nReviewed in the United Kingdom on 1 August 2024\nColour Name: BlackVerified Purchase\nDoes the job for when you have a job that involves lots of screwdriver action. Not the most powerful, but it is relatively inexpensive.\nOne person found this helpful\nHelpful\nReport\nJon\nSurprisingly good quality at this price-point.\nReviewed in the United Kingdom on 13 July 2024\nColour Name: BlackVerified Purchase\nWhen I placed the order for this product I was not expecting too much at this price-point. I was surprised :-) The quality of the product is excellent. The torque is good in that it will defeat even the hardest environment, but not so severe that it will sprain your wrist - that is very good. The assortment of screw heads is comprehensive and should be able to fit any type of screw and the addition of bolt and nut heads is an added bonus. The set includes two long drill bits, which I have already found to be very handy. The flexible bit extension is a brilliant idea and I have already used it several times to access difficult to reach areas. The battery charges via USB which is convenient as it can be charged from any compatible USB power source, including a PC or laptop. After a full charge the battery will last for several hours of work. All of this housed in a nice, strong plastic, custom-made box.....what more could one want for that jobs around the house.\nRecommend? - Yes. Purchase again? - if I ever need another electric drill set, absolutely I would purchase again.\n5 people found this helpful\nHelpful\nReport\nSee more reviews\nTop reviews from other countries\nTranslate all reviews to English\nvardhman jain\nWorks great and excited for my DIY\nReviewed in the United States on 6 June 2024\nVerified Purchase\nI bought this product a month back and it is working great since then for my DIY project\nElectric Screwdriver is a versatile and user-friendly tool designed .
