      "What Are Anal Beads?\n",
      "Think anal beads are the same as butt plugs? Think again. Anal beads are a totally different ball game - literally. They generally consist of a string of smooth plastic, metal or glass beads which get gradually bigger towards the base.\n",
      "Anal bead toys tend to be longer and textured, while plugs are shorter. Also, the pleasurable sensation associated with anal beads is actually in the removal. All sets of beads feature a finger loop or flared base so they can be removed safely, quickly, and easily for maximum satisfaction.\n",
      "Types of Anal Beads\n",
      "Anal beads come in many different shapes and sizes. Whether you’re looking for your first set of anal beads or want to take your play to the next level, our anal bead range has something for everyone.\n",
      "Beginner’s Anal Beads\n",
      "For beginners, we’d recommend a shorter set of beads made from plastic to help ease yourself into anal play. These smooth, PVC BASICS 6-inch Anal Beads are perfect for first-timers. The 6 graduated beads offer fluctuating sensation on insertion and removal.\n",
      "Vibrating Anal Beads\n",
      "If you’re wanting to shake things up a bit, why not give vibrating anal beads a go? The Lovehoney Smooth Mover Beaded Anal Vibrator has a flexible shaft that works with your natural contours for maximum pleasure. This set of vibrating anal beads offers an added level of stimulation that can make masturbation and sex even more fun!\n",
      "Large Anal Beads\n",
      "For those more experienced in anal play and looking for large anal beads, a longer and girthier toy can take your play to a whole new level. The WAD Beyonder Extra Large Anal Dildo lets you indulge in an 11-inch beaded shaft that intensifies orgasmic delights. Large anal beads don’t get much better than this satisying set.\n",
      "How to Use Anal Beads Safely\n",
      "Anal beads are lots of fun, but it’s important to use them properly for maximum enjoyment. Here are our tips for using anal bead toys safely:\n",
      "1. Start off small. If you’re just getting into using anal beads, then it’s best to start with a set that’s relatively skinny. You’ll need to look for beads with smaller balls that gradually increase in size.\n",
      "2. Get clean. Before inserting an anal sex toy, it’s a good idea to clean yourself downstairs. Try to have a bowel movement and clean the area with soap and water around half an hour before play. If you’re short on time, you can use our body-safe wipes.\n",
      "3. Lube up! Grab your anal lube, lubricate the anal beads and your butt, then relax and position yourself comfortably.\n",
      "4. Take it slow and steady. Gently insert the beads one at a time. There's no need to use all of them on your first go!\n",
      "5. Stimulate yourself in other areas. Once you're comfortable, carry on with your normal play, whether that's solo or with a partner.\n",
      "6. Remove and release! As you tip over into orgasm, pull the anal beads out one-by-one at a consistent speed. Welcome to a new level of sensation!\n",
      "7. Don’t forget to clean your toy after play. Use a sex toy cleaner and warm water to clean the anal beads after use.\n",
