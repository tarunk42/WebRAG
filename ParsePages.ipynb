      "Love these so far! I just got them today so the real test will be at work tomorrow but just trying them out for less than a few minutes I found them to be great. My kids were even fighting over them to be their school set. 🤣 thank God they are Bluetooth because my only answer I could think of were they didn't have a cord for their laptops. 😅 overall though they seem a little small on my head but I think that's in part due to have a blue parrot trucker set previously and it's bulky. Ear insides show l and r for right and left which is awesome. It is type c charging and covered while on your head from how the ear pieces twist which is great. When I put them on I thought it was pretty loud but not loud enough for the factory so I made sure the volume was all the way up and it wasn't. It was only 1/2 way which is great because at full volume I couldn't hear my kids fighting so I'm sure it will be loud enough in the factory. Can't say much about battery life just yet as I only tested them out but I can update after work a few days. The buttons are in a nice spot too so I don't turn it off/up/down while adjusting it on my head like my current set. Overall probably the best 50 bucks I spent in a long time. I don't treat myself much or really at all due to being a single mom of 4, the kids and the bills get everything I have 247 but I wanted to make work just a tad bit more pleasurable and these will do it. They don't seem flimsy either which is a plus. Hopefully I still love them in a few months since my blue parrot has lasted 2 years before the mic breaking. These I can answer calls on while working. Pretty excited for work now. 🤣\n",

      "I was wanting these headphones bc I saw them at target a few days ago. They are about the same price as Target. My AirPod Pros don’t work anymore they just die. I only had them since 2021 and couldn’t use them cuz my ears have been sensitive to loud sound since 2021. Plus these don’t fall off like my AirPods do if I move around or out my head down. So I wanted to find a good pair of headphones over ear. These are nice that you can customize the sound with the JBL App. It was a bit confusing at first but then I figured out how to connect them to my phone through Bluetooth no problem. I like that I can switch to vocal sound and video sound when watching movies or shows or listening to music on my phone. I love the lavender color it’s my favorite color. BUT the ear cuffs are so tiny. I have tiny ears but even these are too small for me. It’s a bit difficult to adjust them too for the head. I haven’t figured it out yet to adjust to my size yet. Oh and the headphones bend to close to put away without taking up too much space. They are soft in the ear cuffs. But too small even for me with tiny ears. Makes me sad. I might return these and invest in a pricier pair of JBL over-ear headphones if these don’t work for me. I’ll give it a go and if they still bother me with the tiny ear cuffs then I’ll return them. Oh and I also purchased a case that matches the color of these super cute. Oh also another thing when I set them to studio my ears weren’t hurting cuz I mentioned in my review here that I have sensitive ears since 2021. So having a headphones to not hurt my ears is also important to me. Cuz my AirPods would hurt my ears. So this is my review hope it helps someone decide to get these or not.\n",

      "If you have a small head and little ears these fit perfectly. The sound is awesome and there is an app to control the sound. Super light weight and pretty good with canceling out sound but not fully noise canceling. It was super easy to connect to blue tooth and you can pair them to two different devices. The back of the head phone has a pad so it won't rub on your neck . The only thing that I don't care for is that they kind of hurt my ears after wearing them for a long period of time good for short use though. If you have a bigger head I wouldn't suggest them but good for a Yong adult /adult with a smaller head .\n",

      "Love these so far! I just got them today so the real test will be at work tomorrow but just trying them out for less than a few minutes I found them to be great. My kids were even fighting over them to be their school set. 🤣 thank God they are Bluetooth because my only answer I could think of were they didn't have a cord for their laptops. 😅 overall though they seem a little small on my head but I think that's in part due to have a blue parrot trucker set previously and it's bulky. Ear insides show l and r for right and left which is awesome. It is type c charging and covered while on your head from how the ear pieces twist which is great. When I put them on I thought it was pretty loud but not loud enough for the factory so I made sure the volume was all the way up and it wasn't. It was only 1/2 way which is great because at full volume I couldn't hear my kids fighting so I'm sure it will be loud enough in the factory. Can't say much about battery life just yet as I only tested them out but I can update after work a few days. The buttons are in a nice spot too so I don't turn it off/up/down while adjusting it on my head like my current set. Overall probably the best 50 bucks I spent in a long time. I don't treat myself much or really at all due to being a single mom of 4, the kids and the bills get everything I have 247 but I wanted to make work just a tad bit more pleasurable and these will do it. They don't seem flimsy either which is a plus. Hopefully I still love them in a few months since my blue parrot has lasted 2 years before the mic breaking. These I can answer calls on while working. Pretty excited for work now. 🤣\n",

The only negative thing is that they are not very flexible. I’ve noticed that if I wear them for 30 minutes to an hour, my ears start hurting.\n",

      "Bang for the buck. Extremely lightweight and the equalizer app enriches the sound even further. This is my second pair of JBL headphones and I must say they are amazing especially if you're aren't too picky about headphones. The easy to setup, slim and sleak design and not to mention the great sound makes it a great purchase.\n",

My AirPods hurt my ears and don’t last very long so I decided to find a cheaper alternative and this is definitely a product that is cheap and great quality. Had to come back to give a 5 ⭐️.\n",

      "Great on ear headphones with a phenomenal battery life, came out of the box with 80% charged. Supported by the JBL headphones app so has some features like an equalizer, music/video modes and other options. Buetooth connection was instant, no issues at all. Most importantly, the color is a very nice shade of wisteria.\n",

      "I was wanting these headphones bc I saw them at target a few days ago. They are about the same price as Target. My AirPod Pros don’t work anymore they just die. I only had them since 2021 and couldn’t use them cuz my ears have been sensitive to loud sound since 2021. Plus these don’t fall off like my AirPods do if I move around or out my head down. So I wanted to find a good pair of headphones over ear. These are nice that you can customize the sound with the JBL App. It was a bit confusing at first but then I figured out how to connect them to my phone through Bluetooth no problem. I like that I can switch to vocal sound and video sound when watching movies or shows or listening to music on my phone. I love the lavender color it’s my favorite color. BUT the ear cuffs are so tiny. I have tiny ears but even these are too small for me. It’s a bit difficult to adjust them too for the head. I haven’t figured it out yet to adjust to my size yet. Oh and the headphones bend to close to put away without taking up too much space. They are soft in the ear cuffs. But too small even for me with tiny ears. Makes me sad. I might return these and invest in a pricier pair of JBL over-ear headphones if these don’t work for me. I’ll give it a go and if they still bother me with the tiny ear cuffs then I’ll return them. Oh and I also purchased a case that matches the color of these super cute. Oh also another thing when I set them to studio my ears weren’t hurting cuz I mentioned in my review here that I have sensitive ears since 2021. So having a headphones to not hurt my ears is also important to me. Cuz my AirPods would hurt my ears. So this is my review hope it helps someone decide to get these or not.\n",

      "If you have a small head and little ears these fit perfectly. The sound is awesome and there is an app to control the sound. Super light weight and pretty good with canceling out sound but not fully noise canceling. It was super easy to connect to blue tooth and you can pair them to two different devices. The back of the head phone has a pad so it won't rub on your neck . The only thing that I don't care for is that they kind of hurt my ears after wearing them for a long period of time good for short use though. If you have a bigger head I wouldn't suggest them but good for a Yong adult /adult with a smaller head .\n",
      "Over all super happy with these as I don't feel like they take over my head as I have a small head for an adult .\n",
